- Lab2: Logistic regression, optimization of Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment estimation (Adam), and Scipy Optimize - Sequential Least Squares Programming.
- Lab3: Logistic regresssion, SVM, random forest

## Dataset
- lab1: Generated random dataset.
- lab2: [annual_returns](Lab2/annual_returns.csv)
- lab3: [German credit data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data) from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) fetched by [ucimlrepo package](https://github.com/uci-ml-repo/ucimlrepo) by specifying the identifier 144.
